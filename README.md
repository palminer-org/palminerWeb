# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Scaffold
[fresh-app/factore](https://fresh-app.github.io/fresh-vite-app-react-ts.html)

## Collaborative Development
Using Vercel-based deployment, the main branch of the main repository will automatically deploy to the production environment's official domain. The develop branch is provided as the latest development branch.
To deploy feature branch code independently, please fork to your own repository and use Vercel's free automatic deployment. You can also write your own GitHub Actions to deploy to a machine.

## Development & Debugging
yarn & yarn dev
Before merging to the latest branch, please verify that it runs normally in build mode. Use build & preview to check.

## Others
Tailwind configuration needs to be unified with the design team. API integration is expected to use useRequest. Open to suggestions.
